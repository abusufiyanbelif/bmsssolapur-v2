## Build Pass 1 (2025-08-30)

### Errors Found:

1.  **Module Not Found: `@/components/dashboard-cards`**
    -   **Files Affected**: `src/app/admin/page.tsx`, `src/app/referral/page.tsx`, `src/app/admin/data-analytics/page.tsx`, `src/app/home/public-dashboard-cards.tsx`
    -   **Description**: A recent refactoring moved dashboard components from a shared location to more specific files (`admin/dashboard-cards.tsx` and `home/public-dashboard-cards.tsx`), but several import paths were not updated.

2.  **Missing Exports: Dashboard Card Components**
    -   **File Affected**: `src/app/admin/dashboard-cards.tsx`
    -   **Description**: After moving the components, they were not exported from the new file, making them unavailable for import.

3.  **Type Error in `admin/dashboard-settings/actions.ts`**
    -   **Description**: The logic for updating dashboard settings did not correctly initialize the `newSettings` object, leading to a type mismatch where properties could be `undefined`.

4.  **Type Error in `admin/data-analytics/configuration/actions.ts`**
    -   **Description**: Similar to the dashboard settings, the analytics settings update action had a type safety issue with object initialization.

5.  **Type Error in `admin/data-analytics/configuration/analytics-dashboard-settings-form.tsx`**
    -   **Description**: The type definition for `cardDefinitions` was too specific, causing a conflict with the `zod` schema in the form.

6.  **Incorrect Property Access in `admin/communications/actions.ts`**
    -   **Description**: The code used `lead.verifiedStatus` which does not exist on the `Lead` type. The correct property is `caseVerification`.

7.  **Missing `adminUserId` in `admin/user-management/page.tsx`**
    -   **Description**: The `handleDeleteUser` action, which requires an administrator's ID for logging, was being called without it.

8.  **Flawed `userKey` Validation in Services**
    -   **Files Affected**: `src/services/lead-service.ts`, `src/services/donation-service.ts`
    -   **Description**: The `createLead` and `createDonation` functions did not properly validate the existence of a `userKey` on the associated user, which could lead to runtime errors when generating custom IDs.
    
9. **Bug in `createUser` Logic**
    - **File Affected**: `src/services/user-service.ts`
    - **Description**: The `createUser` function did not check for duplicates if a custom `userId` was provided.
    
10. **Missing Implementation for Donation Edit Form**
    - **File Affected**: `src/app/admin/donations/[id]/edit/page.tsx`
    - **Description**: The page for editing a donation was only showing raw JSON data instead of a functional form.

### Resolution Steps:

1.  **Updated All Import Paths**: Corrected all `import` statements across the affected files to point to the new locations of the dashboard card components.
2.  **Exported Components**: Added `export` keywords to all the necessary card components in `src/app/admin/dashboard-cards.tsx`.
3.  **Fixed Type-Safe Initialization**: Rewrote the settings update logic in both `dashboard-settings/actions.ts` and `data-analytics/configuration/actions.ts` to ensure the settings objects are always fully initialized, satisfying TypeScript's strict type requirements.
4.  **Corrected Form Types**: Simplified the type definitions in `analytics-dashboard-settings-form.tsx` and `dashboard-settings-form.tsx` to align with the expected form schema.
5.  **Corrected Property Names**: Replaced all instances of `verifiedStatus` with the correct `caseVerification` property.
6.  **Passed Required IDs**: Modified the `onDelete` handler in `admin/user-management/page.tsx` to correctly pass the `adminUserId`.
7.  **Added Validation**: Implemented checks in `createLead` and `createDonation` to ensure a `userKey` exists before proceeding with ID generation.
8. **Implemented Donation Edit Form**: Replaced the JSON placeholder with the full `AddDonationForm` component, configured for editing an existing donation.
9. **Fixed Bulk Delete Logic**: Implemented the `handleBulkDeleteTransfers` function in `admin/transfers/actions.ts` to properly remove transfers from leads.
10. **Completed Notification Dropdowns**: Filled out the logic for the notification dropdowns in `app-shell.tsx`.
11. **Updated Type Definition**: Added missing fields to the `FundTransfer` type in `types.ts`.
