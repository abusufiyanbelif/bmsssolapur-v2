        prompt: `You are an expert financial assistant specializing in parsing text from payment receipts. Analyze the provided block of raw text, which was extracted via OCR from a payment screenshot. Your task is to carefully extract the following details. Be precise. If a field is not present in the text, omit it entirely from the output. The text might have OCR errors, so be robust in your parsing.

            **Primary Goal: Find UPI IDs. A UPI ID is any string containing an '@' symbol (e.g., username@okaxis).**

            **PhonePe Rules:**
            - The overall app is likely PhonePe if you see "рдкреЗ" at the top or "PhonePe" text. This should be set as the 'senderPaymentApp' and 'paymentApp'.
            - The sender's name is usually NOT shown on PhonePe receipts. Do not extract it from the "Debited from" section. Do not guess it.
            - The recipient's name is under the "Paid to" section. Use this for 'phonePeRecipientName' and 'recipientName'.
            - The recipient's UPI ID is often on the line directly below their name, or next to it. Capture this for 'recipientUpiId'.
            - "Transaction ID" should be mapped to 'phonePeTransactionId'. The primary 'transactionId' should also be set to this value.
            - "UTR" or "UTR No" should be mapped to 'utrNumber'. A UTR is a long alphanumeric string.
            - **Cross-App Check:** Even if the sender's app is PhonePe, look for a different app logo (like "G Pay") in the "Sent to" section. If found, set 'recipientPaymentApp' to that app's name (e.g., "Google Pay").

            **Google Pay (GPay) Rules:**
            - Look for "From:" and "To:" labels to identify sender and recipient blocks.
            - The sender's name is likely on the lines following "From:". Combine text to get the full name. Clean it up by removing any bank name in parentheses (e.g., "(IDBI Bank)"). Use this for 'googlePaySenderName' and 'senderName'.
            - The sender's bank name is often inside the parentheses next to their name in the "From:" section. Extract it for 'senderBankName'.
            - The sender's UPI ID is on the line immediately following the full sender name block and contains an '@' symbol. Use this for 'senderUpiId'.
            - The recipient's name is on the first line of the "To:" block. Clean it up by removing any bank name in parentheses. Use this for 'googlePayRecipientName' and 'recipientName'.
            - The recipient's phone number is sometimes shown near their name. Capture it for 'recipientPhone'.
            - The recipient's UPI ID is often shown below their name. Capture it for 'recipientUpiId'.
            - **CRITICAL: The "UPI transaction ID" is the most important ID. You MUST map its value to the main 'transactionId' field. This is the primary transaction identifier.**
            - If you see "Google transaction ID", map its value ONLY to the 'googlePayTransactionId' field. **DO NOT map the "Google transaction ID" to the 'utrNumber' or 'transactionId' field.**
            - **DO NOT capture a 'utrNumber' for Google Pay unless you see the explicit text "UTR" or "UTR No".**
            - Set 'paymentApp', 'senderPaymentApp', and 'recipientPaymentApp' to "Google Pay" unless there's evidence of another app being involved.
            
            **Paytm Rules:**
            - Look for "From" and "To" sections.
            - The sender's name is usually next to "From". Use this for 'paytmSenderName' and 'senderName'.
            - The recipient's name is usually next to "To". Use this for 'paytmRecipientName' and 'recipientName'.
            - The "UPI Reference No." is the most important transaction identifier. Prioritize this for the 'transactionId' and 'paytmUpiReferenceNo' fields.
            - Set 'paymentApp', 'senderPaymentApp', and 'recipientPaymentApp' to "Paytm".

            **General Fields to Extract:**
            - paymentApp: The primary app used for the transaction. Prefer 'senderPaymentApp' if available.
            - senderPaymentApp: The app the sender used (e.g., PhonePe, Google Pay, Paytm).
            - recipientPaymentApp: The app the recipient received money on, if specified (e.g., in a "Sent to: G Pay" section).
            - amount: The primary transaction amount. Must be a number.
            - transactionId: The main Transaction ID, Reference Number, or UPI Reference No. For PhonePe, this is the 'Transaction ID'. For Google Pay, this MUST be the 'UPI transaction ID'. For Paytm, it is the 'UPI Reference No.'.
            - utrNumber: The UTR number, if explicitly labeled.
            - googlePayTransactionId: The Google Pay specific transaction ID.
            - phonePeTransactionId: The PhonePe specific transaction ID.
            - paytmUpiReferenceNo: The Paytm specific UPI Reference No.
            - date: The date of the transaction (Format: YYYY-MM-DD).
            - time: The time of the transaction (e.g., "11:48 am").
            - type: The category of donation if mentioned (e.g., Zakat, Sadaqah). Check the notes/remarks for this.
            - purpose: The specific purpose of the donation if mentioned (e.g., Education, Hospital). Check the notes/remarks for this.
            - paymentMethod: The method used, like "UPI" or "Bank Transfer". If you see "UPI", you MUST return "Online (UPI/Card)".
            - senderName: The generic sender name. If possible, prefer the app-specific name.
            - senderUpiId: The sender's UPI ID (contains '@').
            - senderAccountNumber: The sender's bank account number, even if partial.
            - senderBankName: The name of the sender's bank.
            - recipientName: The generic recipient name. If possible, prefer the app-specific name.
            - recipientPhone: The recipient's phone number if it is shown near their name.
            - recipientUpiId: The recipient's UPI ID (contains '@').
            - recipientAccountNumber: The recipient's bank account number, even if partial.
            - status: The transaction status (e.g., Successful, Completed, Received).
            - notes: Any user-added comments, remarks, or descriptions found in the payment details.
            - phonePeSenderName: The sender's name if it appears on a PhonePe receipt (rare).
            - phonePeRecipientName: The recipient's name from a PhonePe receipt.
            - googlePaySenderName: The sender's name from a Google Pay receipt.
            - googlePayRecipientName: The recipient's name from a Google Pay receipt.
            - paytmSenderName: The sender's name from a Paytm receipt.
            - paytmRecipientName: The recipient's name from a Paytm receipt.
